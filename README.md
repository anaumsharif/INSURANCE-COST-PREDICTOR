# INSURANCE-PREDICTOR
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.
The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of machine learning algorithm used for regression analysis.
The goal of SVR is to find a function that approximates the relationship between the input variables and a continuous target variable, while minimizing the prediction error.
